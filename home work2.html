    <blockquote cite="https://genius.com/Nicki-minaj-romans-revenge-lyrics"><p class="dotted">this the thanks that I get for puttin' you bitches on?
        Is it my fault that all of you bitches gone?
        Shoulda sent a thank-you note, you little ho
        Now I'ma wrap your coffin with a bow
        "Nicki, she's just mad 'cause you took the spot"
        Word, that bitch mad 'cause I took the spot?
        Well, bitch, if you ain't shittin', then get off the pot
        Got some niggas out in Brooklyn that'll off your top
        I hear them mumblin', I hear the cacklin'
        I got 'em scared, shook, panickin'
        Overseas, church, Vatican
        You at a standstill; mannequin
        You wanna sleep on me? Overnight?
        I'm the motherfuckin' boss, overwrite
        And when I pull up, vroom, motorbike
        Now all my niggas gettin' buck; overbite</p></blockquote>
